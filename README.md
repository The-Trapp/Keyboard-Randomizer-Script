# Keyboard-Randomizer-Script

Simple script that simulates random keyboard activity and to create hidden backups of itself in randomly generated directories. This is a persistence tool that can distract the user by causing general chaos and directing their attention towards stopping  Additionally, if the script stops or is interrupted, it will automatically restart from one of its hidden backups. The auto-backup and self-restart mechanism ensures that the script continues running even if interrupted.

The self-restart mechanism may not work on all platforms, but it can be replaced by putting the script in task scheduler (for windows) or cronjob (linux)
